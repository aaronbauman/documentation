The first step to launching your site on Pantheon is to upgrade your free Sandbox site to a paid plan. Once the site has been upgraded, you'll have access to features like Custom Domains and free, automated HTTPS.

You can invite a business owner to pay or you can use your own credit card to pay for the monthly subscription:

## Use Your Own Card
If you plan to pay for the site or if you want to wait to transfer ownership, you can skip the invite process and add your own payment method to the site.

1. From the Pantheon Site Dashboard, click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Settings**.
2. Go to the **Billing** tab and select a payment method, then click **Update Payment Method**. You can add a new card or choose from cards already associated with your user account.
3. Select the desired plan from the **Plan** tab, then click **Update Plan**.

As the site owner, you'll receive an email confirming the change to the site. After the site billing is processed, you'll receive an updated invoice.

## Invite a Business Owner to Pay   
This is the most common way agencies handle billing. The invitation will guide the recipient through adding their payment method to the site for the designated plan.

The user who pays for the site is the owner thereafter. Agencies maintain access by being associated as a Supporting Organization.

<p markdown="1">We recommend communicating with the business owner well in advance of sending an invitation. It's a good idea to have them notify you once they've upgraded so you can continue the going live procedure. Feel free to share the [Site Owner FAQ](/docs/site-owner-faq/) guide with them.</p>

1. From the Pantheon Site Dashboard, click **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cogwheel"></span> Settings**.
2. Click **Invite a business owner to pay for this site**.
3. Enter the intended site ownerâ€™s email and select the desired plan.

  The business owner will get an email that directs them to create a Pantheon account or log in to an existing account. Once inside, they need to provide their contact and billing info.

4. Ask the new site owner to add your agency as a [Supporting Organization](/docs/team-management/#add-a-supporting-organization) so you can continue the going live procedure on their behalf.

## Ready to launch like the pros?
Now that you've upgraded your site to paid plan, it's the perfect time to test how your site works in the wild.

### [New Relic APM Pro](/docs/new-relic/#activate-new-relic-apm-pro)
In preparation for these tests, activate New Relic APM Pro so you can observe your site's performance like a maverick. This free service is accessible in the Pantheon Site Dashboard and offers a nearly real-time look into the performance of a web application.

### [Performance Testing](/docs/load-and-performance-testing/#performance-testing)
Measure your site's response time to proactively expose bottlenecks. We recommend running performance tests before you run load tests.

### [Load Testing](/docs/load-and-performance-testing/#load-testing)
Make sure your site can withstand peak traffic spikes after launch. This test should be performed on the Live environment before the site has launched, after performance testing.
